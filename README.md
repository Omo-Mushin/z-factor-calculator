# z-factor-calculator
This is a simple online application for the calculation of the gas compressibility or deviation factor. The gas deviation factor is a crucial parameter in many reservoir engineering calculations. This project provides a quicker way of obtaining the value without the use of the Standings-Katz chart. This is a simple online application for the calculation of the gas compressibility or deviation factor. The gas deviation factor is a crucial parameter in many reservoir engineering calculations. This project provides a quicker way of obtaining the value without the use of the Standings-Katz chart. It has an accuracy of over 99% and also employs proven popular correlations for calculating the Z-factor. Some of this correlations used in creating and programming the calculator are the Hall-Yarborough correlation, Dranchuk-Abu-Kaseem Correlation and the Dranchuk-Purvis-Robinson Correlation.
